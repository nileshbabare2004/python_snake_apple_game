# Snake and Apple Game (Python | Pygame)

## Project Overview
This project is a classic Snake and Apple game developed using Python and the Pygame library.
The snake grows in length when it eats an apple and the score increases accordingly.
The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or its own body.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pygame library
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Project Structure
snake_apple_game.py  – Main game logic  
README.md            – Project documentation  
resources/           – Images and sound files  

## Game Features
- Smooth snake movement using arrow keys
- Random apple generation
- Score tracking system
- Wall and self-collision detection
- Background image and sound effects
- Restart and exit functionality

## Controls
Arrow Keys – Move the snake  
Enter      – Restart the game  
Esc        – Exit the game  

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.x
2. Install pygame: `pip install pygame`
3. Run: `python snake_apple_game.py`

## Key Learnings
- OOP design using multiple classes
- Event handling and game loop
- Collision detection logic
- Multimedia integration in Python
